The deadly attacks have been so brutal, neighbors said they are trying to raise awareness about the dangers in their community. One resident said a neighbor lost a puppy and an older dog to a coyote attack while having a fence repaired. The man said he logged onto Nextdoor.com and saw that he wasn’t the only person to experience the same tragedy. He said if you’re in a car to honk at a coyote and while walking you can use an air horn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

"We were beeping at it, and the coyote just stood in front of the car, stood to the side of the car," she said. "He tried to back up, but the coyote tried to follow us a little." Any person who was exposed to the coyote's saliva through a bite, scratch or fresh wound -- or got coyote saliva in their eyes, nose or mouth -- has had a high risk of exposure. Anyone who observes a wild animal that is sick or acting strangely is asked to avoid the animal and call their local animal control official to report it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

North Ave. shopping center, off North and Sheffield avenues in the Clybourn Corridor area. Suzan Occhipinti, who took the video, wrote that the coyote ran right by her husband’s leg as he was loading up the stroller. “He literally just took the chair and was threatening to attack the coyote,” Dillon told CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar. The other coyote sightings this past Sunday were all just blocks away from Dillon. A video taken Friday also shows a limping coyote in the same Near North neighborhood, right outside a Whole Foods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Ki Ki was in the coyote’s mouth. The limping coyote was seen right outside a Whole Foods store not far from where Ki Ki was attacked. “He literally just took the chair and was threatening to attack the coyote,” Dillon told CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar. On Elm Street near Cleveland Avenue, a man reported a coyote chased after him and his dog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Chicago Animal Care and Control said, as of Monday, it had received at least 10 calls about coyotes within the past week. Kelley Gandurski, the executive director of Chicago Animal Care and Control, said the uptick in sightings was the result of the cold weather and lack of food. City officials urge anyone who comes in contact with a coyote to contact 311 immediately. Should a coyote threaten or attack a pet, residents are asked to call 911 first and then 311.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Several coyote sightings have recently been reported in both the Old Town and Lincoln Park neighborhoods on Chicago's North Side. Chicago Animal Care and Control said, as of Monday, it had received at least 10 calls about coyotes within the past week. Kelley Gandurski, the executive director of Chicago Animal Care and Control, said the uptick in sightings was the result of the cold weather and lack of food. City officials urge anyone who comes in contact with a coyote to contact 311 immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

They plan to relocate it to a safer area in Yellow River Sanctuary.

What our science tells us is that you’re not going to be very successful at trying to remove them permanently.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  13 | Chicago coyote captured after 2 suspected attacks reported - fox2now.com                                               | [Link](https://fox2now.com/news/chicago-coyote-captured-after-2-suspected-attacks-reported/)                                                                                                 | 2020-01-11  | [fox2now.com](https://fox2now.com)                                                  | ['chicago', 'boy', 'told', 'coyote', 'attacks', 'control', 'coyotes', 'captured', 'suspected', 'city', 'reported', 'animal', 'attacked']                                                              | Officials were confident the animal that attacked the boy was a coyote, based on witness interviews, Kelley Gandurski, executive director of the Chicago Animal Care and Control, told reporters. If true, it would mark the first time in the state that a coyote has attacked a human, according to a wildlife biologist with the Urban Coyote Research Project. Two DePaul University track team members were running nearby when the coyote attacked the boy and they helped kick the animal away, according to WBBM-TV. The animal captured on the city’s North Side was chased by police and animal control officials over several city blocks and finally captured near an intersection just after 10 p.m. Thursday, according to WMAQ-TV. Chicago Animal Care and Control urged residents to not leave pets unattended outside and to secure their garbage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

He met the coyote above Medanales quietly, head on, with quick sniffs on both sides. Neither had business with the other, and after a moment, the coyote turned and loped into the sun. They’re spring-loaded capsules smeared with bait; when the coyote bites, it propels the cyanide into its mouth, making a deadly gas. This one is too much like “Mad Max” meets Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

One caveat to the map, which showed no encounters with humans and only one pet lost to a coyote, is residents don’t always report encounters to the Broomfield Police Department, which is how open space tracks the data. “That means … from the eyes of the coyote,” Dunlaevy said. In winter, coyotes can appear larger, but are typically between a lean 30 and 35 pounds. The analysis revealed that pets made up only a small percentage of the coyote diet, and pet consumption decreased when coyote-pet conflicts increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It’s a serious problem.”Danchak said last year a woman from California informed him she had organized a petition effort against the Sullivan County contest that gathered 80,000 signatures. Other cash awards this year in the Sullivan County competition will include $500 for the second heaviest coyote and $250 for the third heaviest coyote weighed. In addition, there will be a $200 prize for the heaviest coyote weighed each day; $100 to a heaviest coyote turned in by a youth hunter (ages 12-15) and $100 to the heaviest coyote turned in by a female hunter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I thought to myself, ‘Oh my gosh, someone just shot the coyote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

(KOLD News 13) - A Marana woman wants to warn other pet owners after a coyote attacked her dog in her backyard. She was cleaning the dishes from breakfast while her 13-year-old dog, Koa, was outside. "I heard Koa making a really weird noise,” Ramirez said. "At first I thought it was my other dog playing with her, so it took a minute because the coyote was huge. She never expected a coyote to attack in broad daylight, and be able to make it over her 6-foot cinder block fence so easily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Speaking to The Times Thursday, BenDavid confirmed the footage was, in fact, a coyote. “We’re not sure if we have two separate individuals living alone on the Island now,” BenDavid said. Coyote hunting season in Massachusetts runs from Jan. 1 – March 7 and Oct. 17 – March 8, 2021. The Island’s resident coyote (or coyotes) came here on their own, most likely swimming from the Elizabeth Islands, BenDavid said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Mr. Ben David said he has contacted the state Department of Fish and Wildlife to report the coyote sighting. “They can live almost anywhere, on the edge of cities or deep in the woods,” Mr. Ben David said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Although coyotes are not native to Florida, Main said they arrived here naturally through range expansion. “The coyote’s range has expanded from the southwest (U.S.) up into Alaska, over to Newfoundland, down to Panama and into Florida,” Main said. They sleep under cars.”Coyotes, which have no significant predators in Florida, typically feed on mice, rabbits, large insects and berries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Shannon Haubrick was out walking her dogs, Yukon and Dodger, in a field between Merivale Road and Woodroffe Avenue late Monday afternoon when the encounter occurred. The dog was attacked and killed by coyotes in Barrhaven on Monday. When she called them back, only Yukon returned. That's when he noticed the second coyote slinking along the edge of the brush that borders the field, closing in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

(WMBF) - The city of Myrtle Beach has relaunched a website to help track coyote sightings along the Grand Strand. The city hopes to create a map of coyote hot spots, as more people fill out the form. “He was standing right over the kayak over there and sniffing around nice and easy and then he went back up jumped to the other side and went to the beach,” Hunn said. Hunn believes the city should do more to help with the problem and that the website isn’t enough.

After continuing to display aggressive behavior, police say an officer fatally shot the coyote to prevent it from attacking anyone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

According to N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, the coyote is native only in North America and, of all wild canine species, the coyote has the widest range in this country. They will scavenge on animal remains, including road-kill, as well as garbage and pet food left outdoors. If you see a coyote frequently, you and your neighbors should take steps to prevent conflicts with it and other wildlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The animal had been shot in the chest with a BB gun, "which could have caused the limp in its movements as well as the aggressive behavior," the Chicago Animal Care and Control (CACC) told CNN through an emailed statement. The child was attacked January 8 in Lincoln Park neighborhood and the animal bit him multiple times. The boy's caretaker repeatedly kicked the coyote until it ran away, Chicago Police Officer Ana Pacheco confirmed to CNN. The child was transported to Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago in stable condition, Pacheco said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The sophomores stopped their run and rushed over to find a young boy crying and bleeding after being attacked by a coyote. After that moment, the coyote never returned, and the two athletes turned their attention to helping the boy and calling for help. “If you see someone that’s being hurt or attacked, you are supposed to help,” Bruce said. But Bruce credits the school for the values they instill in their students and having students buy into the idea of helping the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  36 | Captured Coyote Who Bit Boy Had Previously Been Shot By Someone With A BB Gun, Officials Say - Block Club Chicago      | [Link](https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/01/20/captured-coyote-who-bit-boy-had-previously-been-shot-by-someone-with-a-bb-gun-officials-say/)                                                 | 2020-01-20  | [Block Club Chicago](https://blockclubchicago.org)                                  | ['gun', 'park', 'chicago', 'boy', 'day', 'say', 'coyote', 'control', 'jan', 'officials', 'captured', 'bb', 'shot', 'previously', 'bit', 'reported', 'injured']                                        | CHICAGO — A coyote who bit a 6-year-old boy earlier this month was injured and aggressive, possibly because a person shot him with a BB gun, officials said. Officials said Sunday that DNA testing confirmed the captured coyote was the one who bit the boy. Coyotes typically avoid humans “at all costs,” Stan Gehrt of Ohio State University and the local Urban Coyote Research program previously said. The coyote — who became recognizable quickly because of his distinctive limp — was caught after people reported seeing an injured coyote on the North Side. Animal Control first became aware of the coyote on Jan. 6, when people reported an injured and aggressive coyote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

That’s when “the dad went into protection mode,” kicking the coyote before choking it, said Kensington Police Chief Scott Cain. “From there … I shoved [its] head into the snow … and then eventually was able to expire it through suffocation,” he said. “Ultimately one hand on its windpipe and one hand on its snout did the trick.”The dad was bitten in the arm and chest and is being treated for rabies as a precaution. New Hampshire Fish and Game has the coyote and is taking it to be tested for rabies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Fish and Game officials said they are trying to determine whether the same animal was involved in all three incidents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

In that incident, the dogs retreated into the home, and the coyote attempted to follow them inside, police said.

"The coyote attacked a young child, and the child's dad went into protection mode and suffocated the coyote until it succumbed," police said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Employees managed to coax the coyote off the airfield, and it retreated toward the nearby Salt riverbed, airport officials said. Coyotes can often be found in rural and urban areas across the state, according to the Arizona Game and Fish Department website. Only those with a valid license from the Game and Fish department can capture or kill coyotes, the agency's website says, unless it is an act of self-defense. If you see a coyote, the agency suggests keeping eye contact, making loud noises and throwing small stones as methods for scaring off a coyote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The 2-year-old child’s father, identified as Ian O’Reilly, “went into protection mode and suffocated the coyote until it succumbed,” police said. A coyote is seen walking along a road in Kensington, New Hampshire. The young child was also bitten, though the animal did not break his skin due to a snowsuit he was wearing at the time, according to Boston 25 News. Earlier that morning, police said they received reports of the coyote also attacking a vehicle and biting a 62-year-old woman and her two dogs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

While the City of Calgary has reported a spike in sightings, one coyote expert says it doesn’t mean more of the animals are roaming around. Dr. Shelley Alexander, with the University of Alberta, said it’s likely people have been seeing the same coyotes multiple times. According to data from city parks, there were over 1800 coyote sightings in 2019, up from 1099 in 2018. If you spot a coyote in the city, you’re asked not to approach it and call 311 or report the sighting online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

(Picture: ABC News)A father strangled a coyote to death with his bare hands after it attacked his 2-year-old son. The woman was reportedly attacked by the coyote after she opened her sliding door that led to her porch. Her dogs ran inside her home, but the coyote tried to follow them. It is unclear if that was the same coyote that attacked O’Reilly, or if it was the same coyote that Kensington police shared a photo of shortly after the attack which showed a coyote chasing a car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

On January 20, police were alerted by a car owner in Hampton Falls saying that their vehicle had been attacked by a wild animal. When she realised it was a wild animal, she started to scream to scare the animal away. After being bitten on his chest and arms, O'Reilly grabbed the animal's snout. O'Reilly, Lee, and her dog had to get rabies shots in case the coyote was rabid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Ian O'Reilly said he had "never harmed an animal so it was a weird experience." After the coyote bit him twice while he tried fending it off, O'Reilly kicked it away and used his body weight to suffocate it while holding its snout shut, he said in an emailed statement. "I was able to get its head into the snow and get my hand around its snout, so it could no longer bite me," he said.

Police then received another call that the same coyote was able to enter the enclosed porch of Pat Lee by sliding its glass door. “I was running behind the dogs to get them in, and just as I was here, literally, the coyote bit me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

He was hiking with his family on a trail when the coyote grabbed his son’s coat and dragged him to the ground. He fought back after a coyote bit him twice and tried to run off with his two-year-old son while they were out for a hike. “I was just trying to run in house as fast as I could bite me and it was trying to get into the house," said O’Reilly.

Rosa Bonilla saw a coyote roaming around in broad daylight on Cherry Street near Dewey Street in Sherman. It was just down the street from MasterKey Bilingual Academy and Crutchfield Elementary. She was dropping off her 4-year-old daughter at school and then saw it in a nearby neighborhood. I mean it's very unsafe," Bonilla said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  58 | A coyote attacked a toddler. His father strangled it - New Zealand Herald                                              | [Link](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/a-coyote-attacked-a-toddler-his-father-strangled-it/2U6LDZWC2Q2QVTQ5MMRMQZORWI/)                                                                     | 2020-01-21  | [New Zealand Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz)                                    | ['wmur9', 'father', 'vehicle', 'told', 'coyote', 'lee', 'porch', 'toddler', 'strangled', 'dogs', 'rabies', 'oreilly', 'attacked', 'tried']                                                            | Twenty minutes later, the second caller, a 62-year-old woman, said a coyote attacked her and her dogs on her enclosed porch. Then came a third call, at 11am, with news that the coyote had been strangled by a protective father. Eventually, O'Reilly told WMUR9 that he was able to wrestle the coyote to the ground - and choke it to death. "In the middle of the moment you're not really thinking or recording a whole lot," O'Reilly told WMUR9. "I just started screaming at the top of my lungs to try to get him to stop and go away," Lee told WMUR9.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The series of attacks began after a witness reported seeing a coyote attack a car just before 9am on Monday in Hampton Falls. "The car was trying to get the coyote to move out of the road, and the coyote started attacking the car," Kensington Police Chief Scott Cain told NBC Boston. Two hours later reports came in that the coyote had charged a family walking on a trail in nearby Exeter. "The coyote attacked a young child, and the child's dad went into protection mode and suffocated the coyote until it succumbed," police said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

O’Reilly was walking along a hiking trail with his wife and their three children when one of the children was suddenly pulled to the ground. The couple launched into action, managing to separate the coyote from the toddler, O’Reilly told WMUR. “In the middle of the moment you’re not really thinking or recording a whole lot,” O’Reilly told WMUR. The coyote’s body is also undergoing rabies and DNA testing to verify it was indeed the same coyote responsible for both attacks, CNN reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The coyote was caught and taken in by Chicago Animal Care and Control on Jan. 9, a day after biting the boy in his face in Lincoln Park. Some Chicagoans had been worried the coyote would be euthanized, but Flint Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation — which is caring for the animal — said that won’t be the case. Officials said the attack on the 6-year-old was likely the first reported coyote bite of a human in more than a decade in Cook County. The day after the boy was bitten, someone reported seeing a coyote at Oz Park, which sent Lincoln Park High School into a temporary lockdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The coyote that was killed will be tested for rabies.Fish and Game officials said they are trying to determine whether the same animal was involved in all three incidents.>> Full interview with Ian O'Reilly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

O’Reilly and his wife tried to pull the boy away, kicking at the animal and shooing it away. It didn’t work. Eventually, O’Reilly told WMUR9 that he was able to wrestle the coyote to the ground — and choke it to death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Ian O'Reilly killed the animal with his bare hands after it attacked him and his 2-year-old son. A coyote suspected in three attacks in New Hampshire was strangled by a man the animal attacked. New Hampshire Fish and Game officials confirmed Tuesday that the animal tested positive for rabies and issued a warning, saying that there may be others in the area. Wildlife officials said it is important not to come in contact with wild animals, especially ones that are acting strangely, being aggressive, acting sleepy or walking unsteadily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The coyote bit one of the dogs and bit Lee in the buttocks. “I was running behind the dogs to get them in, and just as I was here, literally, the coyote bit me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

A coyote came into the Collins' backyard, scooped the small dog into its mouth, and jumped the fence. Jason Collins recalls the sight of the dog in the coyote's mouth, saying Rocky looked like a "cotton ball stuck in his mouth." Jason ran after them with a glass in his hand. So, he’s obviously interested in getting after rocky," Jason explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

EXETER, N.H. (AP) — A coyote attacked a pair of dogs, bit a woman and skirmished with a vehicle before being killed by a father defending his family on a walk Monday, police said. The same coyote is likely connected to three attacks that happened relatively close together and throughout the course of an hour, Kensington Police Chief Scott Cain said Monday. Law enforcement officials were searching for the coyote when they got word that it had been killed. The dad went into protection mode and strangled the coyote,” Cain said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

A New Hampshire father has been hailed a hero after strangling a coyote to death with his bare hands after the wild animal attacked his toddler child on Monday. That’s when ‘the dad went into protection mode,’ kicking the coyote before choking it, according to Kensington Police Chief Scott Cain. Pat Lee was bitten as she fought to keep the wild animal out of her house. New Hampshire Fish and Game has the coyote and is taking it to be tested for rabies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Ian O'Reilly told CNN he had "never harmed an animal so it was a weird experience." The coyote has since tested positive for rabies, the New Hampshire Fish and Game said Tuesday, and authorities believe more animals in the Exeter area could have the virus. When an infected animal bites a human, rabies is transmitted from saliva through the open wound and into the nerves, where the virus goes to the brain and spinal cord. CDC experts recommend seeing a doctor for post-exposure treatment soon after contact with an infected animal, before the virus has the chance to turn fatal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The dad went into protection mode and strangled the coyote," Cain said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

And that same coyote has since tested positive for rabies, New Hampshire health officials announced Tuesday. A sergeant with New Hampshire Fish & Game added that the incident began when the coyote attacked one of the father’s three children, who he and his wife were walking with along the trail. That father - who officials later identified as Ian O’Reilly of Kensington, N.H. - was able to kick the coyote away from the 2-year-old child before choking the animal to death.

However, in the struggle, the father was bitten and he had to go to the hospital to receive rabies shots, Cain said. The attack on the family, Cain said, was the third in a string of encounters with the coyote Monday. Then, at approximately 9 a.m., a 62-year-old woman walking her two dogs near her home was attacked by the coyote, Cain said. The woman was bitten, he said, and went to Exeter Hospital to receive rabies shots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

O’Reilly told CNN affiliate WCVB in an interview it took him about 10 minutes to kill the coyote. “In the middle of the moment, you’re not really thinking or … recording a whole lot,” he said. Two hours earlier, another attack occurred in nearby Kensington, according to a Kensington Police Facebook post. Pat Lee and her two dogs were sitting on her porch when a coyote attacked all three, biting Lee in the process, according to WMUR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  76 | Man strangles coyote after animal attacks his child during family walk - USA TODAY                                     | [Link](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/21/nh-man-strangles-coyote-death-after-animal-attacks-his-child/4528502002/)                                                       | 2020-01-21  | [USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com)                                               | ['animal', 'family', 'coyote', 'attacks', 'cain', 'game', 'receive', 'coyotes', 'man', 'child', 'rabies', 'fish', 'strangles', 'humane', 'walk', 'bitten']                                            | Cain said the coyote was only able to bite the child’s jacket before the father grabbed the animal and strangled it to death. However, in the struggle, the father was bitten and he had to go to the hospital to receive rabies shots, Cain said. The attack on the family, Cain said, was the third in a string of encounters with the coyote Monday. Then, at approximately 9 a.m., a 62-year-old woman walking her two dogs near her home was attacked by the coyote, Cain said.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- The coyote captured and linked to attacking a child in Lincoln Park won't be euthanized or released back into the wild, according to Chicago Animal Care and Control.The animal, now named "Mercy", will remain in what officials called a "permanent educational setting" where it will be monitored.CACC Executive Director Kelley Gandurski said coyotes are an important part of the urban ecosystem, preying on small rodents, and typically do not want contact with people.DNA linked "Mercy the Coyote" to the attack of a 6-year-old boy near the lakefront in Lincoln Park on the North Side near the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. The boy was bitten multiple times.The boy's caretaker and two witnesses fought off the animal and the boy was taken to a hospital for his injuries.In a separate incident in Streeterville, a 32-year-old man told police the coyote came up from behind and bit him.The man transported himself to the hospital with minor injuries.A full veterinary medical diagnosis along with daily observations, lead officials to believe that "Mercy" had no signs suggestive of rabies.The facility rehab center that took in the animal said the coyote has not shown aggressive behavior since being treated.Coyotes normally perform an important role in the Chicago area to help control rodent, deer and Canada goose populations. They've long been part of life in Chicago and they're protected by the state.According to the Urban Coyote Project, about 1,000 coyotes are tagged and tracked in Chicago, and an estimated 2,000 in Cook County.CACC said in a statement.Coyote experts warned that the recent coyote attacks may indicate highly abnormal behavior.A look at the city's database of coyote complaints shows a steady increase since July 2019, with more calls this January than any other month last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Police said they believe the coyote attacked a vehicle on a road in Hampton Falls, bit a 62-year-old woman and her dogs on a porch in Kensington and then attacked a family walking on a trail in Exeter on Monday.

During this time, coyotes are likely to be out more frequently and could be more aggressive around dogs or cats. The Portsmouth Police Department encouraged all pet owners to keep all cats inside and to make sure dogs are leashed and within eyesight when outdoors. A coyote could perceive a pet as a rival and attack. A dog was attacked by a coyote in the McCorrie Point neighborhood on Tuesday night and had to be taken to the animal hospital, the Portsmouth Press reported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  87 | Coyote rabies, as found in NH attack, is rare - Granite Geek - Concord Monitor                                         | [Link](https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2020/01/22/coyote-rabies-as-found-in-n-h-attack-is-rare/)                                                                                      | 2020-01-22  | [Concord Monitor](https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com)                           | ['waxes', 'attack', 'carriers', 'animals', 'different', 'coyote', 'coyotes', 'surprising', 'rare', 'disease', 'nh', 'species', 'common', 'rabies']                                                    | Rabies is a complicated disease with different strains that affect different animals species differently, and their prevalence waxes and wanes over the years for reasons not always obvious to us. In general, bats are the mammal that causes the most human rabies infections around the country. Along the East Coast, raccoons are common carriers because that strain of the disease is more common here. Skunks are common carriers in the Midwest and other animals are the main culprits elsewhere – mongoose in Puerto Rico, for example. Before rabies vaccinations became mandatory, by far the most common species to infect humans were dogs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Merely seeing a coyote is NOT a reason to call 9-1-1,” according to a post on the WDNR Facebook page. However, the WDNR post notes, there are exceptions to reporting coyote issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

A group of coyotes may try to entice a dog away in order to attack it to eliminate the threat. “Keeping your dog leashed at all times is the best way to keep it safe.”If you encounter a coyote, Lucila suggests you:· Make the experience unpleasant for the animal. · If the coyote continues to approach, back away slowly and move toward buildings or human activity if the coyote continues to approach. There have not been any reports or complaints to the Ponoka RCMP detachment regarding coyotes in town for the last two months, according to Cpl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Currently, we are in breeding season for coyotes and they can become more aggressive during the reproductive season. Usually, coyotes aren’t aggressive unless threatened or sick, but they are a wild animal and should not be kept as pets. Please note, it is illegal to shoot coyotes within the city limits, and all reports should be made to the Texarkana, Texas Animal Services Department.

The couple reported the attacked happened Thursday night less than a mile from the Drake University campus after they let their dog, Sildi, out in the backyard around dusk, television station KCCI reported. Within minutes, they heard what sounded like a dog fight, rushed outside and found Sildi and the coyote fighting. Residents should stay vigilant and keep pets in the area on a leash, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources said. The department also urged anyone who has had a pet attacked by a coyote to report it to animal control officials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

(WPRI) — Kathy & Rick Updegrove are lucky to still have their beloved 13-year-old dog Jake after he was mauled by a coyote Tuesday night. Kathy told Eyewitness News, like any night, they let Jake outside to answer the call of nature. After stepping out on her back deck, Kathy immediately saw the coyote with its jaws clamped onto Jake’s neck. Lovett says when another large dog is in the area, the coyote demonstrates its dominance, likely why Jake was attacked.

(WTXL) — Bainbridge Public Safety is providing safety precautions for residents ahead of coyote mating season. According to BPS, breeding season peaks in late February/early March and is when coyotes are the hungriest and most aggressive. • If pets must be kept outside, consider installing fencing and motion-activated lights to discourage coyote predators. If you see a coyote in your yard or neighborhood, officials say you must try to scare them away. The animals generally pose little threat to humans but they are still wild animals and should be treated with caution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The Parks Department has received 80 reported coyote sightings city-wide through the WildlifeNYC website in the past three years. Due to sightings of a Coyote in Central Park. Last summer, Parks told Gothamist that coyote sightings have skyrocketed since the agency began tracking them. That same month, a man described being stalked around Central Park by a coyote—possibly the same one spotted in recent weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The next step in his football career is going to take the running back and linebacker for the Chinook Coyotes a little further than that. “I think our program has been building for the past few years, so it’s great to see some guys have success after high school as well,” said Straat. It also stands out as his high school highlight. “Probably my biggest highlight of Chinook football was winning the Division B championship this year,” said Kehler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Q: How much property is required to hunt coyotes in America’s Corn Belt? A: It depends on the specific topography and cover, but in general, if you think of a typical deer-hunting spot, that’s nowhere near enough for coyotes. I want to be in a spot where I have a shot at a coyote that steps out of cover.

Mating season has begun and for the next two months, with the weather warm, the canines will be out, more aggressive and territorial. “We can see, going across the path there, there tends to be packs of coyotes,” said Seuffert. “They tend to do what they’re doing first thing in the morning and then they leave.”Copyright 2020 WOIO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
